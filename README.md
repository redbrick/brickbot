A simple bot for the new [Redbrick](https://github.com/redbrick) Discord.

### How it works

brickbot is very simple. brickbot is just some Node.js which runs as a systemd service, and all it needs to do is make HTTP requests to functions I run using [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas). This means that no matter what your preferred language is, you're able to extend the functionality of brickbot. All I need to do is take your code, and add it to my Docker Swarm. 

If you're interested in OpenFaaS I really recommend trying it out. Serverless is something worth learning (in my opinion), it's really started to change how I write code. There's some great articles out there on it but I personally found [this one](https://medium.com/@thomas.shaw78/bash-functions-as-a-service-b4033bc1ee97) to be the most helpful.

### Contributing

Like I said, it's really easy to extend brickbot. You can help make this bot better by either:

1. suggesting new functionality
2. implementing new functionality

If you're suggesting new functionality feel free to make an issue detailing:
- the name of the command
- a brief description of the command
- any links to repositories that might do something similar to what you're describing

If you're implementing functionality:
- make a PR with the relevant code added to bot.js
- ensure your PR has a link to the code you want deployed with OpenFaaS (I'll make sure it is deployed)
- add your command to the function list in `get_test_set_one` ([in this file](https://github.com/theycallmemac/brickbot/blob/master/tests/endpoints.py)) along with it's expected result of 0 to it's respective list
- add the command and it's creator to the list of functions below
